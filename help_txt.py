    Takes a path to the treatment TSV
    The path may be absolute or direct
    Treatment TSV is used to pair sample numbers with treatment names
    The first column should correspond to sample numbers

    At least one DNA sample must be present for the pipeline to work. All DNA samples should simply be labeled as "DNA"
    If you have multiple replicates of the same treatment they must be the same name
    The sample names may not include "_" "/" or "|" characters 
    The sample names may not include more than one consecutive space

    Do not include a header for your tsv file
    The first column corresponds to DNA sample numbers, the second column corresponds to RNA sample numbers
    Each RNA sample must correspond to 1 and only 1 DNA sample

    6   1
    6   2
    6   3
    7   4
    8   5

    This would mean the DNA from sample number 6 correspond to the Serum Free treatments, 
    the DNA from sample 7 corresponds to the ATP treatment 
    and the DNA from sample 8 corresponds to the Forskolin treatment.
